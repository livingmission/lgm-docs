# Start Staking

This guide walks you through staking your LGM tokens as a delegator to earn rewards.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **1,000+ LGM tokens** for minimum stake
- **Web3 wallet** (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
- **Referral key** or direct invite from a validator

## Understanding Staking

When you stake as a delegator:

1. Your LGM is locked in the ResonanceSystem contract
2. You earn rewards proportional to your stake
3. Rewards are subject to proximity distribution (87% to uplines)
4. You keep 13% of your rewards, minus 10% tax
5. Unstaking requires a 25,000 block (~7 hour) lock period

### Reward Calculation Example

```
Your Stake: 5,000 LGM
Validator Total Stake: 100,000 LGM
Epoch Reward to Validator: 100 LGM
Your Share: 100 × (5,000 / 100,000) = 5 LGM

After Proximity (13%): 0.65 LGM
After Tax (90%): ~0.585 LGM per epoch

Daily (~432 epochs): ~253 LGM
Annual: ~92,000 LGM (~1,840% of stake)
```

<Callout type="info">
Actual returns vary based on network conditions, validator performance, and your position in the proximity chain.
</Callout>

## Staking Process

<Steps>
<Step>
### Connect Your Wallet

1. Go to https://app.fene.network
2. Click "Connect Wallet"
3. Select your wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
4. Approve the connection

**Add Living Mission Network:**
```
Network Name:     Living Mission
RPC URL:          https://rpc.fene.network
Chain ID:         5881
Currency Symbol:  LGM
Explorer:         https://explorer.fene.network
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Get Whitelisted

Before staking, you need to be whitelisted by a validator.

**Option A: Use Referral Key**

If you have a referral key from a validator:

1. Go to "Join Validator" page
2. Enter the referral key
3. Click "Use Key"
4. Confirm transaction

```typescript
// Programmatically
const NFT_PASSPORT = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001001";
const passport = new ethers.Contract(NFT_PASSPORT, ABI, signer);

const referralKey = "0x..."; // From validator
await passport.useReferralKey(referralKey);
```

**Option B: Request Direct Invite**

Contact a validator and ask them to whitelist your address directly.

**Option C: Use Promo Code**

Some validators offer public promo codes:
1. Go to validator's page
2. Enter promo code
3. Click "Apply"
</Step>

<Step>
### Choose a Validator

Select a validator to stake with. Consider:

| Factor | What to Look For |
|--------|------------------|
| **Commission** | Lower = more rewards for you (5-10%) |
| **Total Stake** | Higher = larger share of epoch rewards |
| **Uptime** | Higher = more consistent rewards |
| **Delegators** | Your position affects proximity rewards |
| **Reputation** | Established validators are safer |

**View Validators:**
```typescript
const RESONANCE_SYSTEM = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001000";
const contract = new ethers.Contract(RESONANCE_SYSTEM, ABI, provider);

const validators = await contract.getActiveValidators();
for (const va of validators) {
  const info = await contract.getValidatorInfo(va);
  console.log(va, {
    status: info.status,
    totalStake: ethers.formatEther(info.totalStake),
    commission: info.commissionRate / 100 + "%",
    delegators: info.stakerCount.toString()
  });
}
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Stake Your LGM

Once whitelisted, stake your tokens:

**Using the DApp:**
1. Navigate to the validator's page
2. Enter stake amount (minimum 1,000 LGM)
3. Click "Stake"
4. Confirm transaction in wallet

**Using Contract:**
```typescript
const validatorAddress = "0x...";

const tx = await contract.stakeToValidator(validatorAddress, {
  value: ethers.parseEther("1000") // 1,000 LGM
});
await tx.wait();

console.log("Successfully staked!");
```

<Callout type="info">
Your position in the proximity chain is determined by when you stake. Earlier stakers receive proximity rewards from later stakers.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Monitor Your Stake

Track your staking position and rewards:

**View Your Info:**
```typescript
const [status, stakeAmount, pendingRewards, joinedAt, stakerIndex] =
  await contract.getDelegatorInfo(myAddress, validatorAddress);

console.log({
  status: ["NOT_EXIST", "ACTIVE", "UNSTAKING"][status],
  stake: ethers.formatEther(stakeAmount),
  pending: ethers.formatEther(pendingRewards),
  position: stakerIndex.toString()
});
```

**Estimate Rewards:**
```typescript
const [pending, afterProximity, afterTax] =
  await contract.getEstimatedDelegatorReward(myAddress, validatorAddress);

console.log({
  grossPending: ethers.formatEther(pending),
  afterProximity: ethers.formatEther(afterProximity), // 13%
  netReceive: ethers.formatEther(afterTax)            // After 10% tax
});
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Your Stake

### Claim Rewards

Claim your accumulated rewards:

```typescript
const tx = await contract.claimDelegatorReward(validatorAddress);
const receipt = await tx.wait();

// Parse event for details
const event = receipt.logs.find(
  log => log.topics[0] === contract.interface.getEventTopic('DelegatorRewardClaimed')
);
const decoded = contract.interface.parseLog(event);
console.log({
  gross: ethers.formatEther(decoded.args.gross),
  net: ethers.formatEther(decoded.args.net),
  tax: ethers.formatEther(decoded.args.tax)
});
```

<Callout type="warn">
When you claim, 87% of your rewards are distributed to the 8 delegators who staked before you (proximity rewards).
</Callout>

### Add More Stake

Top up your existing stake:

```typescript
const tx = await contract.addDelegatorStake(validatorAddress, {
  value: ethers.parseEther("500") // Add 500 LGM
});
await tx.wait();
```

<Callout type="info">
Adding stake does NOT change your position in the proximity chain.
</Callout>

### Unstake

To withdraw your stake:

```typescript
// Step 1: Initiate unstake
const tx1 = await contract.unstakeDelegator(validatorAddress);
await tx1.wait();
console.log("Unstake initiated. Lock period: 25,000 blocks (~7 hours)");

// Step 2: Wait for lock period...

// Step 3: Withdraw
const tx2 = await contract.withdrawDelegatorStake(validatorAddress);
await tx2.wait();
console.log("Stake withdrawn!");
```

<Callout type="warn">
**Warning**: Unstaking removes you from the proximity chain. You will:
- Stop earning rewards immediately
- Lose your position (can't get it back)
- Miss proximity rewards from downstream delegators
</Callout>

### Exit from Validator

Remove yourself from the whitelist after unstaking:

```typescript
const passport = new ethers.Contract(NFT_PASSPORT, ABI, signer);
await passport.exitFromValidator(validatorAddress);
```

## Proximity Rewards Explained

The proximity system rewards early stakers:

```
Staking Order:  D1 → D2 → D3 → D4 → D5 → D6 → D7 → D8 → D9 (you)

When you claim 100 LGM:
├── D8 receives: 5 LGM  (Level 1: 5%)
├── D7 receives: 7 LGM  (Level 2: 7%)
├── D6 receives: 8 LGM  (Level 3: 8%)
├── D5 receives: 10 LGM (Level 4: 10%)
├── D4 receives: 12 LGM (Level 5: 12%)
├── D3 receives: 13 LGM (Level 6: 13%)
├── D2 receives: 15 LGM (Level 7: 15%)
├── D1 receives: 17 LGM (Level 8: 17%)
└── You receive: 13 LGM (13%)
    └── After tax: ~11.7 LGM
```

### Maximizing Proximity Rewards

To receive proximity rewards from others:

1. **Stake Early**: Lower position = receive from more people
2. **Stake More**: Meet minimum for each level:
   - Level 1: 1,000 LGM
   - Level 2: 3,000 LGM
   - Level 3: 5,000 LGM
   - Level 4: 7,000 LGM
   - Level 5: 9,000 LGM
   - Level 6: 11,000 LGM
   - Level 7: 13,000 LGM
   - Level 8: 15,000 LGM

3. **Stay Active**: Don't unstake (removes you from chain)
4. **Stake Age**: Must be staked for 100+ blocks

## Staking Strategies

### Conservative

- Stake with established validators
- Diversify across 3-5 validators
- Claim and compound weekly

### Growth-Focused

- Stake early with new validators
- Higher stake to qualify for all proximity levels
- Claim frequently to compound

### Passive Income

- Set and forget with top validators
- Claim monthly
- Reinvest a portion

## Tax Implications

All reward claims are taxed:

| Component | Rate | Destination |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Burn | 9% | Burned (deflationary) |
| Dev Fee | 1% | Development treasury |
| **Net** | **90%** | Your wallet |

## Troubleshooting

### "Not Whitelisted" Error

You need to be whitelisted before staking:
1. Get a referral key from the validator
2. Use the key via NFTPassport contract
3. Or ask validator for direct invite

### Transaction Failing

- Ensure you have enough LGM for stake + gas
- Check you're on the correct network (Chain ID: 5881)
- Verify the validator is active

### Rewards Not Showing

- Rewards accumulate each epoch (200 blocks)
- Check `getEstimatedDelegatorReward()` for pending
- Ensure validator is actively producing blocks

### Can't Withdraw

- Must wait 25,000 blocks after unstaking
- Check `getDelegatorInfo()` for `unstakeBlock`
- Calculate: `currentBlock - unstakeBlock >= 25000`

## FAQ

**Q: What's the minimum stake?**
A: 1,000 LGM

**Q: How often should I claim?**
A: Depends on gas costs vs rewards. Generally weekly or when rewards exceed gas significantly.

**Q: Can I stake with multiple validators?**
A: Yes! You can stake with as many validators as you're whitelisted with.

**Q: What happens if my validator unstakes?**
A: You'll stop earning rewards. Consider moving to another validator.

**Q: Is my stake safe?**
A: Your stake is held in the audited ResonanceSystem contract. Only you can withdraw it.
